                        <strong>Ciphers and encryption in the world of cybersecurity</strong><br>
                        In the world of cybersecurity, ciphers and encryption play a big part in protecting all of our sensitive information as it travels through the internet. When it comes to encrypting and ciphering, there are multiple ways to do that, and we will dive into the world of ciphers and encryption in the digital world.<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>What Are Ciphers?</strong><br>
                        Cipher, also known as encryption algorithms, transform your normal readable plaintext into text that is not readable, called ciphertext. The reason we use ciphers is to prevent any person from entering and penetrating our devices without authorization. Those who have the decryption key are the only people who can decrypt the ciphertext back to normal. Ciphers also have been used for centuries, like the Caesar cipher created by Julius Caesar.<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>The types of ciphers</strong><br>
                        1. <strong>Substitution Ciphers:</strong> This type of cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter. One well-known example is the Caesar cipher. The mechanism works by shifting each letter a fixed number of places down the alphabet, and that number is determined by the person encoding the text.<br><br>
                        
                        2. <strong>Transposition Ciphers:</strong> This type of cipher rearranges the letters that are in the readable plaintext format according to a certain system, like the rail fence cipher, which is a well-known transposition cipher that places the words in a zigzag shape.<br><br>
                        
                        3. <strong>Modern Ciphers:</strong> This type of cipher includes symmetric and asymmetric ciphers. The symmetric type, like AES, which stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, uses the same type of key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric ciphers, like the RSA cipher, use a pair of keys: one public (for the encryption process) and one private (for the decryption process).<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>The Role of Encryption</strong><br>
                        The process of encryption is converting the plaintext into ciphertext using a type of cipher. It ensures that the data cannot be read even if someone manages to get their hands on it. To be able to read it, you need a decryption key. That’s why encryption is important when it comes to protecting sensitive information such as personal communications, online transactions, and confidential business data.<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>Real-World Applications</strong><br>
                        1. <strong>Secure Communications:</strong> With encryption, we can ensure that a user's emails, calls, and messages remain private and secure from any hackers.<br><br>
                        
                        2. <strong>Data Protection:</strong> Sensitive data that is stored on devices and the cloud is encrypted so no unauthorized access can happen and risk losing all of your data.<br><br>
                        
                        3. <strong>Authentication:</strong> Authentication is an important real-world application. We use it to verify our identity when logging into a bank account, and encryption ensures that no one can tamper with this information. The same thing applies to digital signatures and certificates.<br><br>
                        
                        4. <strong>Financial Transactions:</strong> Online banking has become really popular these days, and to have safe transactions, we have to rely on encryption so that during the transaction, no one can get any information from the user.<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>The Future of Encryption</strong><br>
                        As our technology advances, the methods used by hackers to break the encryption also advance. Quantum computing, for instance, poses a potential threat to current-day encryption algorithms. Researchers say that they are currently working on making quantum-resistant encryption methods to ensure safety and security for the future.<br>

                        We had the amazing opportunity to attend Black Hat Riyadh thanks to NCST, and it was an event we will never forget. It was more than just a typical trip; it was an enlightening expedition into the realm of cybersecurity, full of discoveries, difficulties, and thrills.<br><br>
                        Taking part in the Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges was one of the event's most rewarding experiences. As we worked through challenging cybersecurity scenarios, these exercises tested the limits of our problem-solving abilities. Understanding how actual cyber systems function and how vulnerabilities are exploited and mitigated was more important than simply winning. Working with my peers to generate ideas and test solutions under time constraints was exciting.<br><br>
                        Engaging with the businesses that were there was another highlight. We had the opportunity to learn more, ask questions, and investigate their cutting-edge technologies. The trip was made much more worthwhile by the fact that many of the company representatives were kind and willing to share their knowledge. Their observations enabled us to comprehend the real-world uses of cybersecurity across many sectors.<br><br>
                        The individuals I traveled with were what really made my trip memorable. Our teachers were crucial in helping us navigate the event and make the most of our educational opportunities. Their support and knowledge gave our experience a deeper dimension. Furthermore, it was more fun because I was surrounded by my other students. We laughed together, celebrated our little successes, and bonded over common struggles.<br><br>
                        More than just a field trip, going to Black Hat Riyadh was an enlightening experience that expanded our perspectives. We were inspired to study more about cybersecurity and use what we discovered to solve problems in the real world. We are appreciative of NCST for this incredible chance.

                        By Abdulrahman Tariq Mejhem<br><br>
                        <strong>Majoring in Cybersecurity</strong><br>
                        Being a Grade 12 student marks the end of my journey at NCST, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I major in cybersecurity, and it’s something I’ve always loved. Over the years, I’ve always worked with computers—starting by experimenting with developing apps at age 10, then creating fully functional games at 13, and later exploring cybersecurity at 15. I’ve worked hard in school to earn certifications from companies like MongoDB, Cisco, and Amazon. They’ve taught me a lot and guided me onto the right path.<br>
                        One of my favorite moments at this school was the trip they took us on to the Black Hat exhibition for the Middle East and Africa. I joined the Flagyard Capture the Flag competition there, and it was so challenging. On Day 1, I couldn’t hack anything, but on Day 2, I managed to hack something, and I felt great. At that moment, I loved cybersecurity even more—it’s like a puzzle.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Fun at NCST</strong><br>
                        NCST isn’t just about studying all the time. At NCST, I was able to try a lot of new things outside of class, like joining the swimming club, which meets on Thursdays at the end of the school day. Swimming has been a great way to clear my mind and stay active. It’s something that keeps me balanced and helps me avoid getting stressed from school.<br>
                        We also went on a padel trip recently, and it was so fun. It was both relaxing and competitive, and honestly, trips like these make school more enjoyable and fun.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Why NCST is Special</strong><br>
                        There is a lot to love about NCST:<br>
                        The teachers are so supportive and helpful, and they care a lot about you.<br>
                        The facilities are top-notch, especially for the tech resources they offer.<br>
                        There is always something happening—trips, competitions, events, or club activities.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Making the Most of It</strong><br>
                        Life at NCST has been challenging but, at the same time, amazing. Whether I’m trying to hack a machine during a CTF, swimming, or even hanging out with my friends, it’s all a part of the journey. It’s not perfect, but it’s been a big part of who I’m becoming and of my life. I’m excited to see what happens next.</div>

                        My first day at NCST was exciting and thrilling. The first day at NCST was a day to remember. When we reached school, the teachers welcomed us with big smiles as they lined up to greet us. As we walked by them one at a time, we felt their energy and they inspired us. Having developed a strong bond with the faculty, we were introduced at the assembly hall.<br><br>
                        
                        We received a warm welcome from the assembly where the principal was at the front welcoming us all. The principal spoke about the year ahead and the importance of hard work, creativity, and cooperation. The environment was very positive and everyone was waiting eagerly to start their journey at NCST.<br><br>
                        
                        Soon after the assembly, we went to our classrooms for the very first time. Teacher had planned icebreakers which got us to help get to know one another. We had a great time learning some interesting facts about each other, engaging in fun activities and games, and discussing our hobbies. The use of icebreakers was a great way to make new friends and start building community spirit.<br><br>
                        
                        Later in the day, we continued with some more icebreakers and some light introductions to the subjects that we would be studying. We didn’t just learn the syllabus but made friends and learnt the culture of NCST. By the end of the day, we already felt like one of them.</div>

                    <div class="blog-right-page-subtitle"><strong>An Amazing Day at the STEAM Event</strong><br>
One of my best days at NCST was when I went to the STEAM event. STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. The event was organized by the Ministry of Education and gave students a chance to learn new skills. We were invited by our teacher, Mr. Yousif Alawi, who always encourages us to try new things. I went with my two friends, Abdulla Hilal and Ali Waheed, and we were very excited.<br><br>

On the first day, we learned about scientific research. The teachers showed us how to ask good questions, gather information, and find answers step by step. It was very interesting, and we realized how important it is to stay organized and work carefully.<br><br>

On the second day, the focus was on thinking outside the box. The teachers showed us how to solve problems in creative and unexpected ways. They encouraged us to think differently, use our imagination, and look at challenges from new angles. This lesson helped us see how being creative can make even tough problems easier to solve.<br><br>

The last day of the event was the most exciting. We were divided into two teams for a competition. The challenge was to build the best bridge using useless items in a short time. My friends and I worked hard as a team. We used what we had learned about research to choose the right materials, and we added creative ideas to design a strong and unique bridge.<br><br>

When the results were announced, we were so happy to hear that our team had won it. It was such a proud and exciting moment. Winning was great, but what I enjoyed most was learning so much and having fun with my friends.<br><br>

This event taught me the value of both careful planning and creative thinking. Each lesson was important, and together, they helped us achieve something amazing. It’s a day I’ll never forget.</div>
